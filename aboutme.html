							<h1>About Me</h1>
							<img src="images/maxprofile2.jpg" alt="A picture of me behind a desk" />
							<p>I began programming at the age of thirteen. Under the guidance of a book borrowed from the IT teacher, I set about creating simple projects in python in the small computer room off the side of my secondary school common room. I was ultimately allowed to keep the book and I imagine it's the best-thumbed copy in existence.
							<p>Pascal was the language used for teaching at my sixth form, though I continued with my personal python projects as well. While studying, I produced some interesting programs, such as a cryptographic tool that can automatically solve monoalphabetic substition cyphers with remarkable reliability. In this period, I obtained A-Levels in: Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Computer Science. Alongside an AS-Level in English Language.
							<p>I continued my studies with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Warwick - graduating in 2021. While a student, I had the opportunity to explore more programming languages. In particular, Java and C++ which were vital languages for my university projects. I also experienced development with other languages, such as C and Lua. A particularly interesting project involved creating a website from scratch, including designing the forms and the database schema. This project used a variety
							of languages, such as HTML, Javascript, PHP and SQL. The website is called BetterBills and the code is available from my portfolio.	</p>
							<p>For my third year project, I had the privilege of working with Professor Meurig Beynon and Dr. Jonathan Foss on the subject of Empirical Modelling. </p>
							<p>While at university, I worked at Etherton Education over the summers. Etherton is a school for foreign student to acclimatise to the British educational system before beginning their studies in the Autumn. </p>
							<p>In my personal time, I have volunteered with the Basingstoke Rotary on many occasions, where I had the opportunity to collect donations for a charitable cause. In addition, I worked as a car park marshall at a vaccination clinic during the first winter of the COVID pandemic. I am also an avid chess player, having been an active member of the university chess society.  </p>
							<p>Having graduated, I am eager to enter the workplace to further hone my skills.  </p>
